# Titanic ML Project
 A machine learning project using the Titanic dataset to predict survival. Implements exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation with Python.

# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, leveraging machine learning techniques. Using Python and popular data science libraries, this repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Machine learning modeling
  - Model evaluation and comparison

## Data Source

The data was sourced from the [Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes passenger information like age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

## Key Insights

*Highlight a few interesting insights from your EDA, such as the impact of various features on survival chances.*

## Models Built

This project explores several machine learning models, starting with a simple Logistic Regression model as a baseline, followed by more complex models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance.

## Results

*Summarize the performance of your models and highlight the best-performing model based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.*

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to open the `.ipynb` file.
3. Install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and model building process.
